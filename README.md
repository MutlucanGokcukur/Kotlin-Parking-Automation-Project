# Parking-Automation-With-Kotlin
This is my homework that I designed for the database management systems lessons.
In my homework, I used the SQLite database, which works in harmony  with Android Studio.
At the beginning of the project, it is checked whether there is a database on your phone beforehand. If not, it automatically installs the necessary networks.
Then you can use the program without any problems.
This program works with QR application and there is a certain system in QR.
If you want to try it, I have added 4 QR sample images into the programs file.
I hope you like my program. I would be very happy if you give feedback as a comment.

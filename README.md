# Parking-Automation-With-Kotlin
This is my homework that I designed for the database management systems lessons.
In my homework, I used the SQLite database, which works in harmony  with Android Studio.
At the beginning of the project, it is checked whether there is a database on your phone beforehand. If not, it automatically installs the necessary networks.
Then you can use the program without any problems.
